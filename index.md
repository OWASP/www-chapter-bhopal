<h4> **Description:** </h4>         
<p>
     <br>
Join us for an evening dedicated to mastering the art of secure coding and conducting effective code reviews. This event, hosted by the OWASP Bhopal Chapter, is designed to promote collaboration and knowledge sharing in the critical areas of cybersecurity, software security, and secure development practices.
Building on the success of our previous events like "Revisiting Cyber Security & 101 with ML" and "ML Huddle & Cracking the Cybersecurity Puzzle" this session will delve into the best practices and strategies for writing secure code and performing thorough code reviews to enhance software security.
<br> <br>
We'll explore key principles of secure coding, including how to identify and mitigate common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and buffer overflows. The event will also cover effective code review techniques, emphasizing the importance of peer reviews and automated tools in detecting and resolving security issues early in the development process. By integrating these practices into your workflow, you can significantly reduce the risk of security breaches and ensure your applications are resilient against attacks.
<br> <br>
Whether you're an experienced cybersecurity professional or a developer eager to improve your secure coding skills, this event offers the perfect platform to connect with peers and deepen your understanding. Join us for an insightful session on the latest techniques in secure development, the importance of rigorous code review processes, and the newest developments within the OWASP community. Let's work together to strengthen the foundations of secure coding and make the digital world a safer place for everyone!
<br> <br>
Don't miss this opportunity to take control of your online security and protect what matters most. Reserve your spot today and embark on a journey towards a safer digital future!
